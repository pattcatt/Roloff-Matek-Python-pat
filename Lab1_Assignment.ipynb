    "*Our group in machine design class is assigned to design a chain transport system. This system is used to move coal carts from a ship to the factory in the EU economic area. A motor is used to drive the system where its power is transmitted through a pulley-belt and a single step gear box.*<br> \n",

    "## MOTOR SELECTION\n",
    "To select a motor, we must define its power rating. The power rating in this system is dependable on the efficiency of the motor, the belt system and the gear box, also the operating factor which is known as Ka which depends on its operating condition. \n",
    "This gives us formula as follows to determine the motor power rating.<br>\n",

    "The efficiency of the V-belt system is taken conservatively at 80%, major commercial V-Belt manufacturer claims its product maximum efficiency is 97%, and the efficiency of the gearbox with spur gear is 99% (RM CH20). This makes the total efficiency Î· total = 77.6%.\n",
    "The system is operated with electric motor, 20 hours per day for 250 days per year which gives its KA according to the Figure 3 (RM Table 3-5), $K_A = 1.4$.\n",

    "The system is operated with electric motor, 20 hours per day for 250 days per year which gives its KA according to the RM Table 3-5 is 1.4. The figure below give the overview of steps taken to obtain the Ka Value\n",
    "\n",
    "![image of chain](./tables/RM35.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "With total efficiency and the $K_A$ value is known then the $P_i$ motor power input is found with value 10606 watt. From the motor selection table 16.21 then it is decided to select a motor with a power rating of **P_motor = 11 kW**."
